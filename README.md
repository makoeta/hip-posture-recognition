# üßç Hip Posture Recognition

### **Welcome to the Hip Posture Recognition project!**

The Hip Posture Recognition Project has been developed to help patients analyze and improve their posture in preparation
for upcoming X-ray scans.
The system provides a live video feed in which patients can see themselves on a screen with guiding lines overlaid to
help them identify and correct poor posture in real time.

This README is intended for users such as doctors and medical professionals who want to understand how to use the system
effectively.
If you are a developer looking to contribute or extend the project, please refer to the
separate [README4DEV.md](./README4DEV.md) for
technical documentation and setup instructions.
